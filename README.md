## About this project

This project was designed & built in under 48 hours for the [Mintbean Careerhack Hackathon](https://www.mintbean.io/). It was [nominated first place](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mintbean_100daysofcode-quiz-music-activity-6718598666141138944-c-ai)

## How to use

The quiz can be difficult to answer for users without the knowledge of a musical instrument. However, the app UI should make it at least understandable for everyone. 
1. Choose a quiz to play.
2. Press "Play" and listen to the notes. If you are on a mobile device, make sure you are not in silent mode.
3. Try to reproduce the notes heard on the keyboard. There will be visual feedback (green/red) on the notes telling you if you've succeeded. 
4. After finishing every round, the final score will be displayed.
